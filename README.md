# Monte Carlo solver for Poisson or Laplace equations

<poisson.py> makes a comparison of
- [Relaxation or finite difference method](fd.py) and
- [Random walk Monte Carlo sampler](mc.py) (simple implementation)
for several Poisson and Laplace problems.

## Simple implementations of
- [3D Random walk Monte Carlo](mc3d.py)
- [Walk on Spheres](wos.py) (translated from C++ to Python)
- [Walk on Stars](wost.py) (translated from C++ to Python)
